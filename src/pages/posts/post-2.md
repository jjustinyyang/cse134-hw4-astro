# Experience  

## Internships  

### Software Engineer Intern, Tag-N-Trac
**June 2024 - Aug 2024 (San Diego, CA)**
- Designed and implemented an AI assistant in Python using OpenAI's Assistant API for natural language queries on the Tag-N-Trac dashboard, enhancing user experience, query efficiency, and analysis ability.
- Implemented backend integration with Tag-N-Trac API endpoints for comprehensive asset lifecycle tracking, sensor data retrieval, alert management, and report generation, streamlining logistics and monitoring processes.
- Engineered OpenAI Assistant instances to interpret user queries, extract relevant parameters, and deliver accurate, analytical, and formatted responses.

### Software Engineer Intern, Hermes Epitek
**July 2023 - August 2023**
- Built a dynamic web app for customizable data visualization using JavaScript, PHP, Chart.js, and MySQL.
- Transformed raw factory alarm data into interactive graphs, improving accessibility for operational insights.
- Enhanced data accuracy and accessibility by integrating APIs for querying and filtering database information.

## Research

### Software Researcher, UCSD Computer Science and Engineering
**September 2023 - June 2024**
- Developed "Proofessor", an AI tutor leveraging the GPT-4 LLM to guide students in writing informal mathematical proofs in UCSD's Discrete Mathematics course, achieving improved tutoring efficiency compared to traditional methods.
- Utilized Python and prompt engineering to interface with the OpenAI API, creating dynamic, multi-round interactions with students, and providing tailored feedback on proof-writing stages, from problem comprehension to proof validation.
- Integrated auto-formalization of students' proofs into Lean 4, providing a robust second layer of verification to the AI tutor's responses.
- Utilized the Gradio framework to develop an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

## Clubs

### Embedded Systems Developer, UCSD Triton Robotics
**September 2022 - 2023**
- Developed power management software in C++ on STM-32 Nucleo boards, optimizing power distribution for RoboMaster robots.
- Implemented PID tuning for motor control, improving stability and responsiveness in robotic movement.

## Tutoring

### Computer Science Tutor, UCSD Computer Science and Engineering
**September 2023 - December 2023**
- Led lab sessions for 80+ students in CSE 15L (Software Tools & Techniques Lab), teaching Linux, Vim, shell scripting, JUnit, and Git.
